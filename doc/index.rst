REM news
========

The RAS executable model (REM) will be rolled out publically at the National
Cancer Institute’s first `RAS Initiative Symposium
<https://ncifrederick.cancer.gov/events/Ras2015/>`_ to be held December 15-16,
2015 at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research in Maryland.
Individuals interested in this meeting should register at the `NCI Frederick RAS
Initiative Symposium website
<https://ncifrederick.cancer.gov/events/Ras2015/>`_.

The model itself will be undergoing a dramatic expansion and update prior to
this meeting using automated modeling tools that have recently been developed by
investigators in the DARPA Big Mechanism Program, which supports this resource.
At the Dec 15-16 meeting participants will be invited to suggest corrections or
updates to the model and these updates will be made in near real-time to test
the performance of the modeling environment.
